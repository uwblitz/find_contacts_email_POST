# thunderbird_email_worm
This code only finds the users email and name, retrieves email from contacts, find smtp server and port. The next versions of this code will need to create and send email, deal with the password issue for logging into smtp server, and install a "file" in targets directory.

TO DO: The code to send email and install a file (respresenting something malicious) has not be added.
